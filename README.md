My GitHub repository houses my early React projects, showcasing my growth and experimentation in front-end development. Join me as I explore this powerful JavaScript library, crafting dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

The "001-to-do-list" project is a task list developed using React. This application allows users to create a list of tasks, edit, and delete them when necessary. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing tasks.

The "002-weather-app" project is an application that displays weather information. It utilizes React to create a dynamic and interactive user interface for retrieving and presenting weather data. Users can input their location and receive real-time weather updates, including temperature, location and more.
