# Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find my early React projects, showcasing my growth and experimentation in front-end development. Join me as I explore this powerful JavaScript library and create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

## 001-to-do-list

The "001-to-do-list" project is a task list developed using React. This application allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks as needed. With its intuitive and user-friendly interface, managing tasks becomes a breeze.

## 002-weather-app

The "002-weather-app" project is an application that displays weather information. Leveraging the power of React, it provides a dynamic and interactive user interface for retrieving and presenting real-time weather data. Users can input their location and receive updates on temperature, location, and more.

Feel free to explore these projects and witness my journey in front-end development!
